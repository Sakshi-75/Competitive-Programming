# Competitive-Programming
My programs for various competitive programming questions.
These are the codes I submitted on various online coding platforms for solving various problems.
While my attempt is to always achieve a 100% score by passing all the test cases, I do fail to do so at times and would really appreciate if someone could help me figure out how to improve the programs.
Hopefully they will help others to understand various logics of solving a particular problem through my programs and together we can all improve our coding and problem solving ^u^
